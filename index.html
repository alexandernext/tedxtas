							<h2>What is TEDx?</h2>
							<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxTaipeiAmericanSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxTaipeiAmericanSchool event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

							<h2>Oliver Feuerhahn</h2>
							<h3>Class of 2018</h3>
							<p>Oliver Feuerhahn is a junior at Taipei American School. He's attended Taipei American School since the first grade and loved the innovation and creativity that the school immerses students in. In his time at TAS, he has participated in athletics, MUN, NOVA, and more. He stresses the importance of creativity in every student's education. Despite understanding the significance of a traditional education, he hopes every student understands the fact that education in itself should not be governed by tests assessing the same skills when every student is unique in their abilities. Ultimately, he hopes his audience be it students, teachers, or parents, will put greater emphasis on creativity in education, as our society evolves, so should our education. </p>

							<h2>Vivian Teng</h2>
							<h3>Class of 2017</h3>
							<p>Vivian is a senior at Taipei American School. She lived in California for the first few years of her life before moving to Taiwan. She never actually really enjoyed the arts until her freshman year of high school. Now, as a potential architecture or design student, she finds interests in visual arts. She also enjoys math though unfortunately she is not very talented in that area. She hopes to promote art and design throughout modern society as the fine arts are nowadays often being overlooked as people tend to focus more on STEM now. In her free time, she enjoys playing volleyball, assisting the community through clubs such as World Vision and Athletics Council, and exploring food around Taipei.</p>

							<h2>Annabel Uhlman</h2>
							<h3>Class of 2018<br/>Speaking with Fiona Tsai</h3>
							<p>Annabel and Fiona are two upperclassmen in Taipei American School. They met in jazz band three years ago and have been enjoying ice cream adventures, music performances, and star war movies together since then. Yoda once said, ‘beware of the dark side’. But too often, people avoid talking about the dark side. Annabel and Fiona think it is time to start an open discussion with the school community on this issue. They will be sharing a first and third person perspective on depression and mental health. Since every case is different, there is no one solution nor is there a list of exact steps to follow. However, they hope that they can reach out to those who are struggling and that we as a community can develop a more accepting mindset. </p>

Janice is an avid MUN-er and has an interest in international relations and psychology, but at the same time pursues intellectual journeys in the math and science realms of academics.

							<h2>Seamus Boyle</h2>
							<h3>Class of 2017</h3>
							<p>Seamus Boyle is a senior and a TAS “tiger baby”, currently in his 14th year at the school. A dabbling speaker, athlete, and writer, he enjoys sharing his ideas with as many as are able (or willing) to listen to them. He particularly enjoys finding innovative, subversive ways of addressing previous schools of thought. Often interpreting books, movies, and other media in vastly different ways from his friends and family, he hopes to bring the radical element that has fueled so much discussion in class and in other discussion to his TEDx presentation, hopefully for the benefit of the audience. With his presentation on the mistakes we make, he hopes to help us rethink the values we have been taught since childhood.</p>

							<h2>Dustin Rhoades</h2>
							<p>Mr. Rhoades has been a teacher, for the past 21 years, in the United States, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, and Taiwan. He first developed an interest in arthropods (especially insects and arachnids) while accompanying fifth graders to Camp Taiwan in 2008. Watching students go from being afraid of "bugs," to appreciating them through brief interactions, made him realize the hunger people have for connecting to the "smaller side" of our natural world. Since purchasing his first macro lens in 2013, he has spent a little time each week photographing arthropods and sharing his shots with friends around the world. Through macro photography, he hopes to increase appreciation for arthropods and raise awareness of their importance to humanity. </p>
