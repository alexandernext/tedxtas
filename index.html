						<h2>What is TEDx?</h2>
						<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxTaipeiAmericanSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxTaipeiAmericanSchool event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

						<h3>CLASS OF 2017</h3>
						<p>Haley is a sophomore at TAS. She's a bookworm and a treehugger and she's proud of it.

Haley's life is mainly MUN, cooking, photography and running. She aspires to be a professional librocubicularist and is currently working hard to get in all the necessary practice. She thinks that above all else, humanity needs to stop asking questions. Haley is excited to be speaking at the first TEDx event at TAS and can't wait to see what it has in store for us!</p>
